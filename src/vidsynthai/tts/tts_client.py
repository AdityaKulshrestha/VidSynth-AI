    First, we recognize this is in standard quadratic form axÂ² + bx + c = zero. Here, a equals one, b equals negative five, and c equals six.  

    We need two numbers that add up to negative five and multiply to six. Let's test factor pairs of six...  

    Negative two and negative three satisfy both conditions: their sum is negative five and product is six.  

    This lets us factor the equation as (x minus two)(x minus three) equals zero.  

    Using the zero product property, either x minus two equals zero or x minus three equals zero.  

    Solving both equations gives us x equals two and x equals three.  

    Let's verify by substitution. Plugging two into the equation... and three... both satisfy the equation.  

    The final solutions are boxed two and boxed three."""
